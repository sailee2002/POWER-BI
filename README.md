This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing sales, profit, and quantity metrics for a Superstore dataset from 2014 to 2017. 
The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales, profit, and quantity, as well as visualizations like sales by region, profit trends by year, and sales 
distribution by segment. It also features a city-wise sales and profit breakdown and dynamic filters for region, segment, sub-category, and order date, enabling detailed 
exploration of business insights. This project demonstrates skills in data visualization, storytelling, and creating actionable insights for decision-making.
